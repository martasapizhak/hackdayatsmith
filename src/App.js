              <h1>What is HackSmith?</h1>
              <p>HackSmith is a virtual 24 hour Smith College hackathon run by Smithies in CS, Smithies in SDS, and the SDS Coalition of Color. HackSmith is an opportunity to try out new challenges, attend workshops, and meet new people. We aim to foster a space for interdisciplinary creativity.
              We've had an unprecedented amount of interest this year and are no longer able to accept new participants.
              <h1>Our Sponsors</h1>
              HackSmith wouldn't be possible without the generosity of Audible, the Conway Center for Innovation, The Design Thinking Initiative, and MassMutual.
              <h2>Design Thinking Initiative Support</h2>
